Playback Experience Tech - Product and Program Team 

Team Overview
Playback brings the technologies, tools, and operations to stream Live, Linear, and VOD content to all devices globally. Our infrastructure brings flawless, high-quality streaming while using the fewest bits possible. We aim to deliver a better experience than broadcast. We innovate to efficiently manage our global scale across CDNs, ISPs, every sort of home network, and 10K+ device models. Video playback includes acquiring the video (and audio) content from partners, Encoding (compression) of the video, policy enforcement to meet locale and studio requirements, measuring the quality of the experience (QoE), vending of all playback resources, managing the storage of the content, delivery of the video fragments over CDN / ISP networks to the customer's device and the playing back of the video on the customer's device including UI control of the video player. Playback also manages our operational team responsible for monitoring and mitigating our video delivery solution, including VOD, Live Events, and Linear channels. We also constructed the Analytics system that measures our video playback, including an AI-based monitoring and alerting system to identify issues in real-time. We can then root causes and swiftly mitigate these on a global scale. The data generated by the Playback system is the source of truth for video consumption and usage. We share the data in a privacy-safe manner across all stakeholders. In addition, our infrastructure optimizes video delivery across the network in real-time so viewer always get the best possible quality that their network and device is capable of supporting. Finally, we provide video playback to our tenants, such as Freevee and Music, bringing economies of scale and innovation to Amazon video properties.

We split our team into the following product and program clusters:

Encoding and Picture Quality (PQ)
Live Streaming - Live Events and Linear
Playback Services and Video Delivery
Video Player, Playback Experience, Video Analytics, Optimization
Live and Linear Program Management
Quality of the Experience (QoE) and Picture Quality (PQ) Program Management

Mission
Prime Video Playback technologies are the benchmark for video streaming, providing the best viewing experience for our customers globally. Amazon's best-in-class library (VOD and Live) will always be the preferred choice for customer entertainment anywhere and on any device. Our applications and services are secure, protecting content (Amazon and partners), customer information, and our business. In the future, our solution will allow us to support >500MM active customers worldwide in the most cost-effective way possible while enabling multi-tenants to promote their video business expansion.

Our mission is to build and operate the most innovative video streaming technology that provides the best streaming for VOD and Live across all devices globally. We measure our success by delivering the earth's most customer-centric streaming globally. We built a multi-tenant stack used and extended by other organizations in Amazon. We secure our digital content to maintain trust with our partners.

Our Tenets (Unless You Know Better...)
We willingly adopt Audio/Video (A/V) streaming standards and implement them at scale. We invent new A/V tech without constraints on behalf of our customers, influencing original equipment manufacturers (OEM), content delivery networks (CDN), internet service providers (ISP), industry partners, and standards bodies to adopt our proposals and innovate with us. We do not merely adopt emerging tech. We strive to invent them.
We operate our services by continually improving 1) reliability and availability, 2) video experience and picture quality, and 3) new customer-facing capabilities. When we have to make tradeoffs, we prioritize in the order listed.
We design our services with multi-tenancy and decoupling in mind. Our stakeholders shouldn't rely on us to deliver for their customers. When we slow them down, we'll take a step back and assess how to enable them to move fast and increase velocity.
Delivering video at scale reliably is a complex problem involving complicated tech and expertise. We are biased towards developing and operating these technologies in-house and fall back to third-party (3P) technology when we see an opportunity to accelerate customer benefit.
We will continuously lower the cost of bits-on-the-wire while ensuring we don't compromise the perceived customer viewing experience.
We launch new products and services with scalable, automated processes. Any exception is a highly considered decision with a swift plan to close the gaps. We will not launch a new feature directly on high-profile content. We will instead iteratively deploy on low-impact and low-risk content. When we have high confidence, we will roll it out for high-profile content.

Team Overview
Our team is responsible for the sound development of the playback solution. The team assesses, defines, prioritizes, and supports the development of solutions for the video playback organization. We prioritizes our roadmap based on our customer obsession - across the video playback organization. The team defines and captures the strategic vision, establishes the roadmap, defines the requirements, and works closely with engineering teams to execute on our vision. The groups encompass the entire video pipeline, including Video Players (Android, Web, iOS, Living Room), Encoding, Live Playback, Video Delivery, Playback Insights, Content Access, Playback Services, and Playback Experience. We drive Product Mechanics, focusing on a well-understood cadence, transparency, accountability, and customer value. We write 3-year Vision documents, PRFAQs, BRDs, Product Goals and metrics, and requirements documents outlining the customer experience. We jointly work with engineering teams to define our technical approach and workback plans. We are customer-obsessed and partner with all stakeholders to ensure we deliver the best experience for our customers. We synchronize with the industry to influence their roadmaps and technology decisions to align with Prime Video's vision. We determine long-term leapfrogging ideas for the future of digital video consumption, focusing the team on the execution of the next-generation playback technologies and experiences that delight our customers.

Success Metrics
Customer Experience & Satisfaction
We measure our performance holistically using several metrics for each critical aspect of our business. Our solutions aim to improve key business metrics such as 1) Hours Streamed (Absolute and CAGR), 2) Peak Concurrent Plays (Absolute and CAGR), or 3) Number of Monthly Active Users (MAU). We group Playback critical metrics into the following categories: 1) measure our ability to scale, 2) the Quality of the Experience (QoE) rendered to our viewer, 3) the perceptual Picture Quality (PQ) of our streaming, 4) the customer satisfaction driven by our video Playback capabilities, and 5) our Cost and Operational Efficiency of running the video infrastructure.

We measure our Scale and Availability with Peak Concurrent Plays (PCP) sessions (in Million/M), # Video Streams (in Billion/BN), # Viewing Hours Streamed without issues (in Billion/BN), # Countries, # Linear Stations, # Live Events, # Live Events on Linear (LEL), # VOD Titles (in MM titles), # of Broadcast Hours for all Live Events, Total Bytes Delivered (in Petabyte/PB) and % of Traffic delivered with CloudFront
We assess our customer Quality of Experience (QoE) with % Time Spent Buffering, Time-to-First-Frame (TTFF), Zero Error Rate (ZER), Zero Buffer Rate (ZBR), Exit Before Video Start (EBVS), and Buffering Abandoned Plays (BAP). We strike a balance to optimize for these metrics, aiming to drive a "better than broadcast" experience given constraints such as available bandwidth, cap limitation, and cost
We assess our customer Picture Quality (PQ) by leveraging the % of HD and UHD fragments for suitable sessions. We optimize for High Dynamic Range (HDR) and Dolby Vision coverage. We also use subjective testing and golden eyes to assess our quality. We introduce new measurements with Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion (VMAF at P90, Amazon Quality Measurement, ITU-T REC P.1204) to improve our quantification in this area. These PQ metrics use mathematical models to compute the video quality automatically
We assess Customer Satisfaction when we launch new capabilities and value brought by our video experience - usability testing, NPS, or other proxies such as social metrics or press clipping. We evaluate customer engagement with playback capabilities - Reviews & feedback, Customer sentiment score, app store ratings for video playback
Finally, we obsess about our Cost and Operation Efficiency with KPIs such as Playback Cost Per 1000 Streams (CPS), Encode cost Per Hour (EPH), CDN cost, and per Linear station cost. We also measure our operational and monitoring efficiency by leveraging KPIs such as Operators per Live Events or Linear stations.
Finally, we aim to constantly improve the speed at which we deliver new capabilities to our customers. We strive for faster roadmap velocity and value brought to our customers and stakeholders. The product & program team must increase predictability with a sustained cadence understood by all. We reduce blockers reported and lower scope-cuts/scope-creep to meet deadlines and expectations. We support engineering in reducing counts of defects reported during delivery and better handling of quality levels. Finally, our team aims to reduce our churn by making our work enjoyable with a purpose for both the team and our stakeholders - continuously working on our connection scores and bringing the maximum value to our customers.

Video Innovation
Innovation focuses on rising the bar in Camera-to-Cornea customer experience though industry and stakeholder collaboration, whole product perspective, and get patents. Prime Video works with many external and internal partners from content producers to post houses, validation and analysis tools, encoding and packaging tools, CDNs, and consumer electronics companies. As new technologies and features constantly emerge, we need to focus on those that will provide customer value, and work with partners to bring them to market quickly, efficiently, and with high quality. Much is done bilaterally, delivering Prime Video first technologies like HDR10+. We also build upon many industry standards, and Prime Video contributes to standards that raise the bar for customers, like Filmmaker Mode.
While Prime Video is made by a huge number of teams and individuals all working on aspects of the service, Our customers receive Prime Video as a whole product. We innovate looking at the big picture for cross-team bar-raising efforts. Examples include recommending cameras and settings for Amazon Studios, delivering more consistent audio loudness, and providing customers optimum picture modes.

Playback Services and Video Delivery
This product area owns the end-to-end flow from when the customer hits play until their playback session is complete.  We build the integration point between backend services and customer-facing video players to 1) deliver the correct stream entitlement, 2) optimize manifests for the customer and device, and 3) enforce the concurrency limits set by subscription policies. It also covers services that protect content (DRM, Geo Services, VPN abuse) and tracks user sessions to ensure they can resume where they left off on any device. Our video delivery services takes the encoded bits from content origins and delivers the asset to our customer's devices over the internet. We continuously ensure the availability and network capacity to bring millions of concurrent streams to customers reliably across CDNs, ISPs, mobile networks, and home networks. We build with AWS and 3P providers, caching capacity and content as close to the customer as possible. Using real-time data and ML optimization, we determine the most cost-effective network path for a customer session while providing the highest quality stream.

Quality of Experience (QOE) and Picture Quality
At Prime Video, we serve Live, Linear, and VOD streaming through multiple 1p and 3p channels to customers world-wide on a multitude of devices using various internet providers/infrastructure. Historically, Prime Video has measured the success of our customer quality of experience by a set of KPI’s based on calculations using sums & averages at the stream level implying all streams impact the customer equally. This program (Farpoint) will challenge that assumption by zooming in on a set of measures that distill the impact to a combination of customer, location, ISP, and device related experience to better address the bulk of customers that we can further delight.  Unaddressed, this cohort of customers can lead to loss of trust in Prime Video, drive customers to stop engaging with Prime Video (using other streaming services), and create reputation for Prime Video as unreliable in those cohorts. Our goal is to lead the industry with the best streaming experience worldwide and continue to surprise and delight our customers.

Our team also owns the Page 0 metrics for Prime Video Playback that are used to regularly measure the progress toward the yearly goals.  To drive this, we focus on these  key areas: 1) Metric alignment with PV OP1/OP2 goals by working with DVPI to ensure the correct metrics are surfaced and defined appropriately; 2) Regular checkins (CPR starting Jan-01-2023) to review findings, improvements, and regressions in quality for our customers.  3) Identification of blind spots and addition of metrics to continuously monitor newly identified issues; 4) Working with Player teams, delivery tech, encoding, and any other pertinent team to improve QOE and PQ for Prime Video customers.
